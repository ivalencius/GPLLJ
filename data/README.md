## IPCC-WGI-reference-regions-v4_coordinates.csv
The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provides a grid of 57 different regions. We will use the Central North America (CNA) region as the backbone of our regridding. The CSV file was downloaded from [The ATLAS archive](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/blob/devel/reference-regions/IPCC-WGI-reference-regions-v4_coordinates.csv). The CSV contains the vertices of the region and is in EPSG:4326.
